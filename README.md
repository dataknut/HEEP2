## HEEP1
The original Household Energy End-use Project ([HEEP](https://www.branz.co.nz/environment-zero-carbon-research/heep/)) study was a long-term study with the objective to measure and model the way energy is used in New Zealand households. The project commenced in 1995 with a pilot study and progressed to detailed data collection in 400 houses throughout New Zealand. The sample included households from large and small cities, urban and rural areas and both the North and South Islands from Kaikohe to Invercargill. Each house was monitored for about 11 months.

HEEP monitoring activities included a detailed occupant survey as well as a detailed house energy examination. The monitoring covered all fuel types (electricity, natural gas, LPG, solid fuel, solar water heaters) as well as temperatures in at least three locations.

Data collection was completed in 2005, and from year 9, the reports provided regional and national statistics.

## HEEP2
HEEP2 will be the same. But different :-)
